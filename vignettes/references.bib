Researchers may resort to expensive solutions such as cluster hardware for large analysis tasks. Graphics processing units (GPUs) provide an inexpensive and computationally powerful alternative. Using R and the CUDA toolkit from Nvidia, we have implemented several functions commonly used in microarray gene expression analysis for GPU-equipped computers.Results: R users can take advantage of the better performance provided by an Nvidia GPU.Availability: The package is available from CRAN, the R project's repository of packages, at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gputools More information about our gputools R package is available at http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/brainarray/RgpgpuContact: Â bucknerj@umich.edu}",

@Article{cuRnet,
   abstract = {R has become the de-facto reference analysis environment in Bioinformatics. Plenty of tools are available as packages that extend the R functionality, and many of them target the analysis of biological networks. Several algorithms for graphs, which are the most adopted mathematical representation of networks, are well-known examples of applications that require high-performance computing, and for which classic sequential implementations are becoming inappropriate. In this context, parallel approaches targeting GPU architectures are becoming pervasive to deal with the execution time constraints. Although R packages for parallel execution on GPUs are already available, none of them provides graph algorithms.},
